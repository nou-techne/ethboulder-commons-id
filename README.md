# ETHBoulder · commons.id

**A living archive of what emerges when people converge.**

This repository hosts the ETHBoulder 2026 convergence instance of [commons.id](https://commons.id) — a knowledge-graph-backed platform for capturing, classifying, and connecting the ideas that surface at convergence events.

**Live at:** [ethboulder.commons.id](https://ethboulder.commons.id)

## What It Does

Participants contribute observations — ideas, proposals, commitments, questions, patterns, reflections — through natural language. An AI extraction pipeline classifies each contribution using two orthogonal systems:

- **REA Grammar** (Ring 1) — Resource (stock), Event (transformation), Agent (participant)
- **e/H-LAM/T Dimensions** (Ring 2) — Ecology, Human, Language, Artifact, Methodology, Training

The result is a navigable knowledge graph that grows in real time as the event unfolds.

## Features

- Single-textarea contribution with AI-powered extraction
- Six dimension lenses (e/H-LAM/T) for navigating the knowledge graph
- Interactive force-directed graph visualization
- Live event dashboard for projection displays
- Full-text search across artifacts and contributions
- Participant profiles with contribution history
- JSON-LD data export for interoperability
- Magic link authentication (no passwords)

## Stack

- **Frontend:** React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Edge Functions, Realtime)
- **AI:** Claude API for knowledge extraction
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages
